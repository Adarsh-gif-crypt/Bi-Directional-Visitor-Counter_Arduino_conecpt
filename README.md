[Bi-directional visitor counter](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3zi9Xgrxlq9-bidirectional-visitor-counter-004-092-112/editel?sharecode=YX43uy5qsMu9XtBga7S7M2oYjEG_lWzSh3d9BD6N4kE) concept implemented in AutoDesk's Tinkercad.

## Introduction
The main objective of our project is to make a system capable of counting the amount of visitors/objects that enter a particular doorway/archway and also the amount of outgoing 
visitors/objects. This in turn also helps us count the amount of people attending the event.

## Explanation
Visitor counting is simply a measurement of the visitor traffic enteringand exiting conference rooms, malls, sports venues, etc. With the increase in standard of living, there 
is a sense of urgency for developing circuits that would ease the complexity of life.
